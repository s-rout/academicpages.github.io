## Bio

I am a 4th year PhD student advised by [Prof. Wouter Serdijn](http://bioelectronics.tudelft.nl/~wout/) at the Bioelectronics Group, TU Delft. I work in the field of analog and mixed-signal circuit design and conduct research on developing efficient architectures for the acquisiton of cardiac signals. I am also working on compressed-sensing to acquire multi-channel atrial electrograms efficiently.
