I am a PhD Student of prof. [Wouter Serdijn](http://bioelectronics.tudelft.nl/~wout/) at the Bioelectronics Group, TU Delft.

I am working in analog and mixed signal circuits design. My main research interests lies in sigma-delta analog-to-digital converters, compressed sensing based analog front-ends and their applications in cardiac signal acquisition.
