## Compressed-sensing analog front-end (AFE) for the acquisition of atrial electrograms (AEG)

1. Proposed rakeness based compressed-sensing to acquire multichannel atrial electrograms (AEG); Results presented at IEEE ISCAS 2019. [Paper] (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8702398)
2. Filed provisional US patent titled "Rakeness-based compressed-sensing of atrial electrograms" [Link](https://patents.justia.com/inventor/samprajani-rout)Date: April, 2019. 
3. Hardware architectural modeling of CS-AFE for multichannel AEG acquisition
4. Integration of flexible array and AFE for use at Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam

## State-space approach for designing high-pass $\Sigma\Delta$ ADCs for the acquisition of electrocardiogram (ECG)

1. Proposed a state-space methodology to synthesize arbitrary signal transfer characteristic $\Sigma$$\Delta$ ADC.
2. Dynamic range of the proposed orthonormal $\Sigma$$\Delta$ ADC improves by 3 dB.
3. Taped out a state-spaced based high-pass sigma-delta ADC AFE for ECG signal acquisition.
